Hello! Welcome to my website.

I am a Ph.D. candidate at Washington University in St. Louis, focusing on comparative politics and quantitative methods. I am on the job market in the AY 2025-2026

Primarily, my research focus is on representation. Substantively, I examine factors that changed public substantive preferences and, consequently, shape their voting behavior. For example, I analyze issues such as immigration and policies for minorities that lead to changes in voting preferences. I am also interested in electoral systems, causal inference, and Latin American politics in general. I have used a range of quantitative methods, statistical software, and languages to assess those topics and to support several large-scale research efforts. My work contributes to our understanding of current and relevant topics in Latin America. 

I am proudly Brazilian and a Flamengo supporter. You can get in touch with me at [raduaneugenio@wustl.edu](mailto:raduaneugenio@wustl.edu).
