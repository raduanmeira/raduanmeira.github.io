Hi! 

I am a third-year political science Ph.D. student at Washington University in St. Louis, focusing on comparative politics and quantitative methods. 

The emphasis of my substantive research is on the interaction between political institutions and political behavior. More precisely, I am interested in how institutions condition elites' actions, especially the action of radical and anti-establishment politicians. I have a regional focus on Latin America. Methodologically, I am interested in survey experiments and causal inference.  

Besides academia, I like to cook, watch soccer, and enjoy a cold beer with friends.

I am proudly Brazilian and a Flamengo supporter. You can get in touch with me at [raduaneugenio@wustl.edu](mailto:raduaneugenio@wustl.edu).
