Hello! Welcome to my website.

I am a Ph.D. candidate at Washington University in St. Louis, focusing on comparative politics and quantitative methods.

My research investigates how socio-cultural factors, like immigration, lead to changes in political behavior. I am also interested in the rise of populism, electoral systems, causal inference, and Latin American politics in general. My work contributes to our understanding of populism in developing countries, enlarging our understanding of these phenomena. I have used a range of quantitative methods, statistical software, and languages to support several large-scale research efforts 

Besides academia, I like to cook, watch soccer, and solving all the problems of the world at a bar table with some friends.

I am proudly Brazilian and a Flamengo supporter. You can get in touch with me at [raduaneugenio@wustl.edu](mailto:raduaneugenio@wustl.edu).
