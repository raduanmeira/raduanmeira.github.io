1. Immigration without mediation: Brazilians reaction to an influx of Venezuelans
	
	**Abstract:** What is the impact of immigration shocks on the voting behavior of native populations? While numerous studies explore (a) natives' attitudes toward immigrants and (b) the electoral appeals of anti-immigrant parties, much less is known about how immigration impacts the electoral performance of incumbents. I argue that voters feel threatened by an immigration influx, leading to political discontent. Consequently, higher exposure to immigration results in a lower voting share for incumbents. I empirically test this argument by analyzing the impact of the Venezuelan immigration influx in Brazil during the 2018 Brazilian national elections. In contrast to advanced democracies, where immigration debates often feature prominently, no major Brazilian presidential candidate addressed immigration during the 2018 campaign. Using an instrumental variables and a difference-in-difference designs, I find an effect that immigration shocks promote anti-incumbent behavior. The findings offer empirical evidence supporting the notion that heightened immigration levels can trigger a political backlash. _Last update 08/11/2025_

2. The Importance of the Socio-Cultural Dimension in Latin American Politics

	**Abstract:** In advanced democracies, the literature has long acknowledged that the ideological dispute is between two dimensions---a 	socio-cultural (GAL--TAN) and economic---in those countries. However, the relevance of the socio-cultural dimension has been overlooked in the Latin American context, where the literature focuses solely on economic issues. I argue 	and provide evidence that a socio-cultural dimension is salient for Latin Americans. This change has happened because new topics, related to tradition, have arisen in the region that made socio-cultural topics consequential in conditioning political behavior. This importance derives from socio-cultural issues being more cross-cutting with economic issues due to a transition in which collection of ideas is used to define the socio-cultural dimension. The consequence of the two dimensions being more cross-cutting is that socio-cultural themes are more salient. I perform a country- and individual-level analysis to gauge this change in the socio-cultural dimension and to assess that it has become more cross-cutting with economic issues. I assess the importance of socio-cultural factors through a new IRT measurement that gauges the underlying ideological dimensions across all 23 Latinbar\'ometro waves. These results have implications for our understanding of Latin American politics by stressing overlooked saliencies. Moreover, this research helps in bridging the scholarly gap between the political reality of Latin America and that of advanced democracies. _Last update 08/19/2025_

2. Border lines and Party lines: The effect of borders on voting behavior in Brazil (with [Amaan Acharaniya](https://sites.wustl.edu/amaancharaniya/))

	**Abstract:** How does immigration shock affect natives' voting behavior? While numerous studies explore (a) natives' attitudes toward immigrants and (b) the electoral appeals of anti-immigrant parties, much less is known about how immigration directly impacts the electoral performance of incumbents. Following group threat theory, I argue that voters feel threatened by an immigration influx, leading to political discontent. Consequently, higher exposure to immigration results in a lower voting share for incumbents. I empirically test this argument by analyzing the impact of the Venezuelan immigration influx in Brazil during the 2018 Brazilian national elections. Unlike  advanced democracies, no major Brazilian presidential candidate addressed immigration in their 2018 campaign. I use the distance to the border as an instrumental variable to establish a causal link between immigration shock and voting behavior against the incumbent. The findings offer empirical evidence supporting the notion that heightened immigration levels can trigger a political backlash. _Last update 08/19/204_
